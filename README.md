# copy-paste-url-markdown
Press Alt+C (or âŒƒ+C on macOS) to copy "[website's title](website's url)" to the clipboard.

I use a markdown editor to take notes. I want the URLs to be displayed nicely in preview mode, without me having to do the manual edits, hence the creation of this extension.

Also, the extension has an option to exclude [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) (if there is any). I just want the URL to look a bit nicer.
