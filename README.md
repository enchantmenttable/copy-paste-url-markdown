# copy-paste-url-markdown
Press Alt+Shift+C (or âŒƒ+Shift+C on macOS) to copy "[website's title](website's url)" to the clipboard.

I use a markdown editor to take notes. I want the URLs to be displayed nicely, without me having to do the manual editing, hence the creation of this extension.

Also, the extension has an option to exclude [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) (if there is any). I just want the URL to look a bit nicer.
